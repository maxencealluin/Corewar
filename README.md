# Corewar
A reproduction of the Corewar game: Virtual Machine with GUI using Ncurses library, Assembly compiler and champion written in redcode.



Core War was inspired by a malicious virus written in the 80â€™s. To deal with the self-replicating virus, a white hat hacker invented Reaper. It was a virus designed to spread and eliminate the malware. He fought fire with fire.

This inspired A. K. Dewdney to coin the idea for Core War.

The idea was simple. You compete by designing viruses to overtake a computer. You win by protecting your own program and overwriting your opponent's programs. This is all happening on a virtual machine.

Our implementation looks like this:
